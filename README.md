Runmix is a react-based SSR framework, created from scatch. 

Runmix borrows name from Remix, and runs for purpose of learning.

A full step-by-step course is being written at the same time. Almost every chapter of the course has a correspondent commit in this git repository.

The course will be published in [Runmix official site](https://runmix.dev), and [RunJS](https://runjs.work), which also benifits from Runmix.

If you are a contributer of Runmix, you will get the course for free.
